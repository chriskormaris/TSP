# TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) Plot

A brute-force approach. Written in Java using the GRAL Library. Complexity: O(n!)

An algorithm that finds and prints a tour that passes from every city.
The city coordinates can either be read from a text file, or be randomly generated.

**Note:** The algorithm gets very slow for a number of cities greater or equal to 10.
